I had been created a Billing System.In this I had been created the CRUD Operation using Nodejs,Express,MongoDB,Postman API.The user can able to add the products and they can do their billing
system based on their convenience using Create,Read,Update and Delete.The user can able to create the products and the user can able to read the products whatever they are going to create and 
we can able to update the products whenever the user has interested to buy more products based on their convenience and the user can able to delete the products when they didn't like that products.
The billing count will be manually decreased and increased based on the count and the quantity and the price of the products.The UI of the BillingSystem will be updated soon.Now I had been launched a
simple crud operation.By future I will implement the projects in the form of website and host it so that user can able to access.
